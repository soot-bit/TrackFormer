## Overview

TrackFitting is a novel approach to particle trajectory reconstruction using Transformer networks. By leveraging the powerful self-attention mechanism of Transformers, our model is able to effectively capture long-range dependencies in particle event data, leading to improved accuracy and efficiency in track fitting tasks.

## Features

- **Transformer-based Architecture**: Our model utilizes a Transformer-based network, which allows for efficient and accurate particle track reconstruction.
- **PyTorch Lightning Integration**: The project is built using PyTorch Lightning, a high-level deep learning framework that simplifies model training and evaluation.
- **Modular Design**: The codebase is designed in a modular fashion, making it easy to experiment with different model architectures, loss functions, and training strategies.
- **Comprehensive Logging and Visualization**: The training process is accompanied by detailed logging and visualization capabilities, powered by TensorBoard and other tools.
- **Scalable and Efficient**: The model can be trained and deployed on various hardware configurations, including GPUs, to handle large-scale particle event data.
